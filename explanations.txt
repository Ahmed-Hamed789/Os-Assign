Exercise 1: Using fork()
The program uses the fork() system call to create a new process. The child process prints its PID, and the parent process prints its PID. This demonstrates how a process creates a copy of itself.

Exercise 2: Background Processes
The program creates a child process that runs in the background while the parent continues execution. The parent uses waitpid() with the WNOHANG option to check on the child without stopping its own work.

Exercise 3: Stopping Processes
The program creates a child process and then stops it using the kill() function with the SIGTERM signal. This shows how to terminate a process programmatically.

Exercise 4: Pausing and Resuming
The program pauses a child process using the SIGSTOP signal and later resumes it using the SIGCONT signal. This demonstrates controlling the execution state of a process.

Job of the Linker
The Linker combines compiled object files into a single executable program. It resolves references to functions and variables across different files.

Job of the Loader
The Loader loads the executable program from the disk into memory so it can run. It also loads any necessary shared libraries.
